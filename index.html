    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        An individual, detail-oriented teamplayer, that is how I would be described in my environment.
        I love working with people just as much as on my own.
        My interests lie with everything that has to do with languages, including computer languages.
        Being raised in a world full of computers, I have always been interested in working in the online world.
        For this reason, I started following a course about web development and web design, hoping to build such a portfolio so I can start my own business.

                <i>September 2022 - May 2023</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                From September until December, I have worked under Dr. Paz González as a general student assistent, helping her with her research and create the start of her funded project: an academic student journal.
                In January, we finished recruiting more students and the rest of the period I have worked as an editor of the new journal: <a href="https://www.thenewscholar.nl/index.php/tns">The New Scholar: Leiden Student Journal of Humanities.</a>

            </p>
            <p>
                As a mentor, I assisted new students at our BA program with creating their own path within the university.
                I informed them about the details of the program, and was their go-to person for questions, doubts and/or problems.

    <h2>Extracurricular activities</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Volunteer work</b><br/>
        I volunteered to be a buddy of someone with multiple disabilities, mentally and physically.
        My main goal was to provide company to a woman to prevent loneliness.
        We drank coffee biweekly and chatted about her day.
        We also went to town a couple of times or took a walk outside.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Board membership study assiciation</b><br/>
        I have fulfilled various roles within the association.
        From 2020 until 2021, I worked as the vice-president and the social media manager.
        During the second year, I covered the role as co-president together with one other member.
        My main goal was to be the face of the association.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Participation councils</b><br/>
        During my studies at Leiden University, I have participated in two councils within the program: the Program Committee and the Program Board.
        The Committee supported the Board with official cases regarding the program.
        I have worked as a sounding board for students in the Commmittee and as the voice of all students in the Board.
        Work I have done is handling complaints, co-designing and implementing the curriculum, mediating between students and staff, among other things.
